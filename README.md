# Appearance extension

An Obsidian plugin to set up preferred theme for each color scheme and allow quick scheme toggle from workspace.

## Features

- Toggle dark/light/adapt to system color scheme from workspace.
- From plugin setting tab, select preferred theme for light vs dark mode. When color scheme is changed manually or automatically (adapt to system), the corresponding theme will be applied. This theme will overwrite the theme selected in Appearance tab.
